DESCRIPTION

wikileaks-mirror.pl is a Perl script, which returns either a working random Wikileaks mirror or a complete list of working mirrors.
It can write the list to a file and read from that again to prevent downtimes of the official Wikileaks Website.

OPTIONS:

	-l				print mirrorlist to stdout

	-lo <outfile> 	print mirrorlist to file

	-r				print random mirror from wikileaks website

	-ri <infile>	print random mirror from file 
	

To redirect your website users to a random Wikileaks mirror, you can use this php code:

	$mirror = shell_exec('/path/to/wikileaks-mirror.pl -r');
	header ('Loation: ".$mirror);
